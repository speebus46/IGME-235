## Action Replay! "It's Metal Gear, but...yahh. It's rewind time!"

### Concept/genre

In the top-down shooter _Action Replay_, you are trying to achieve an objectve as a secret agent. However, security is tight and you only have a day to complete the mission; you'll need to play risky! The goal of this game is to create a secret-agent themed game which replaces the passive tension of typical stealth-action games with an _active_, action-oriented tension. This game will be desktop only.</div>

### Story

You play as a secret agent sent to infiltrate an enemy base and steal an improtant, unknown "asset"; but the mission was so urgent that you got no prep-time, so you and the agency you work for know nothing about the base. This dire situation called for you being equipped with time-manipulating technology, for use however you see fit. Use it creatively and precisely to succeed in your mission! The player will not progress explicitly. That is, there is one long "level" where the player can use a method of time travel to undo their mistakes; they progress as they learn about the base, and identify key places/objects/people/etc. They win by utilizing this information to obtain the "asset" and complete the mission however they see fit (stealing weapons, sneaking, etc). </div>

### Gameplay

The player can enter and maveuver through the base via whatever is available, within reason. The player moves with WASD from a top-down perspective. E interacts with certain objects, right-clicking will attack with whatever weapon you have equipped. Left click will cause the player to sneak, though this does not guarantee them being hidden. There is an in-game clock which is 20 minutes in real time The "F" key will bring up a rotational menu with certain time-gadgets (which are not finalized), each with different functions.  
The ideal three gadgets would be:*   a gadget to send items to a time and place*   a gadget which will, after 5 minutes, return you to that location _and the time you placed it_, _with_ your inventory*   a gadget which lets you rewind/undo time completely by in game hourThe Tab key will bring up a menu, includig a map (which the player unlocks by exploring).  
All of this is taught in a short tutorial on a trail leading to the base; learning how these abilities and other abilities in-base function will be trial and error.  
Some strategies a player could use include:  
Breaking into the armory and sending weapons to useful locations via time-gadgets, preparing for a shootout.  
Sending miscellaneous items to different places/times to manipulate guards.  
Whatever else the player can think of!</div>
